    <p>Right… What the hell is this?</p>
	<p>Well, that’s one example of copywriting that <u>doesn’t work.</u></p>
	<p>Copy that talks about Me, not You, that doesn’t talk to the reader – it talks at him, copy that’s boring.</p>
	<p>Obviously, it’s an exaggerated example.</p>
	<p>But “all exaggerations prove a general concept”, or something, where have I heard that before?</p>
	<p>…</p>
	<p>Uhh, nevermind.</p>
	<p>The thing is: the kind of copy at the top of this page? It’s <u>copy done by people who don’t know how to do copy.</u>
</p>
	<p>Bad copywriters or just company owners doing their own thing and hoping it would work out.</p>
	<p>And what about well written copy, what can that do for your business?</p>
	<p>Well, here’s a find from Gitnux’s 2025 Copywriting Report:</p>
	<img src="assets/salespitchstat.png" class="gitnux-stat">
	<p>This means that copy done well returns $42 for every $1 spent.</p>
	<p>And that’s <u>on average.</u></p>
	<p>Another fact is that:</p>
	<h2>Sales letters are used so often in the health & wellness niche because they work particularly well, leading to results no other marketing channel gets even close to.</h2>
	<p>Are we on the same page now? (Probably not, I’m not really browsing my portfolio 24/7)</p>
	<p>Are you the owner of a health & wellness brand?</p>
	<p>Unless you’re lost on the Internet, if you’re browsing this, and my marketing worked, you probably are.
</p>
<h2>So now I will talk all about what makes health & wellness ads work… How they need to make use of before and after comparisons to really trigger that emotional response in the reader and…
</h2>
	<p>Blah, blah, blah.</p>
	<p>Since when do doctors explain to you all they’ve learned over the years in med school before they operate on you?</p>
	<p>So why has it become an established practice in copywriting to do just that?</p>
	<p>Look, I’m not new to this. </p>
	<p>I know how to write sales letters for health businesses that do their job (the job is to convert readers into clients).</p>
	<p>You should probably look at the stuff I’ve written over the years if you don’t believe me: <a href="projects.html">look at my projects</a>.</p>
	<p>The thing is, you need results.</p>
	<p>I write the copy that gives results.</p>
	<p>Because I know my stuff. And I know how this industry works. So I know how to write copy for this industry that works.</p>
	<p>I think you already know where this is going…</p>
	<p>If you think hiring somebody you’ll pay $500 to write you a sales letter in a specialized niche is a good idea…</p>
	<p>Or, even better, doing it yourself…</p>
	<p>Then we’re not the right fit.</p>
	<p>If, on the other hand, you agree with me that:</p>
	<p>If good products in the health & wellness niche want to go far, they need great marketing that will bring them more customers…</p>
	<p>And that hiring someone with experience in the field and a skill in writing really good-damn copy (again, <a href="projects.html">portfolio</a>) will help you do that…</p>
	<p>Then here’s my email:</p>
	<p>kml.siatka@gmail.com</p>
	<p>And here's my face. So that you know who you're working with.</p>
